ip-stack provides a very simple TCP stack; it is currently quite
"alpha"; in particular the connection state machine has known bugs
which may prevent it from being stable over the long term.

The interface is located in tos/lib/net/b6lowpan/interfaces/Tcp.nc is
necessarily more complex.  In particular, buffering is a significant issue.

In this iteration, per-socket buffers must be provided by applications
from an accept() or connect() context.  The stack will manage the
buffer; copying new data into the transmit buffer, while storing
out-of-order segments in the receive buffer and maintaining a bitmap
of which sequence numbers have been received.

Usage

There is currently no available documentation or examples of the tcp
implementation.
