<h1>TinyOS 2.x Contrib</h1>

<p>
The tinyos-2.x-contrib module is a collection of contributions from
the TinyOS community. Unlike the TinyOS core, which is maintained by
working groups, contrib is maintained by individual contributors. The
two are maintained separately and must be downloaded separately. The
contrib directory of TinyOS 2.x is made of up a number of project
directories. The look at the current set of projects check out the
index.
</p>

<p>
The contrib directory is managed by one or more caretakers that
compile an index of the current projects and tries to ensure that the
project are reasonably easy to use.
</p>

<h2>Using the contrib directory</h2>

If you wish to use one of the projects in contrib you must obtain a
copy of the current <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=28656">CVS repository</a>.


<h2>Contributing code</h2>

<p>
We welcome code contributions to the TinyOS 2.x contrib directory and
have tried to make contributing code as easy as possible. If you have
a project that you feel is interesting for others and would like to
share it you should follow the steps below. We will provide you with a
directory under the tinyos-2.x-contrib, the name of this directory can
represent your institution or the name of the project. Your project
will be entered in the index with a short description that you provide
and the index will point to a longer description located in your
project directory. You should think of you directory as you
<i>domain</i> in which you control what is going on - the role of the
caretaker is to provide you with this directory and to make sure that
the project stays with the guidelines.
</p>

<p>
Your project directory should mimic the directories of the core
distribution, however it should not copy the content of the core
distribution. We can create the directories for you if you are
unfamiliar with the directory structure. You should only put code and
documentation in you contrib directory if you need video, audio,
sensor data you will need to place it somewhere else (say your own
website).
</p>

<p>
The structure will contain some or all of the following sub directories:
<ul>
<li>index.html
<li>apps
<li>tos/chips
<li>tos/platforms
<li>tos/sensorboards
</ul>
</p>

<p>
To obtain your project directory:
<ol>
<li> Write an e-mail to "contrib@tinyos.net" with the following information:
<li>  A name for the project
<li>  Your preferred directory name for the CVS tree
<li>  A short (3-4 sentence) description of the project for the index
</ol>
</p>

After you have obtained you directory you must ensure that it follows
the directory structure and that an index.html file is provided.
