***** tos/lib/tossim/sim *****

Implements CC2420 functionality for TOSSIM.  Supported features include:

- Ieee154MessageC
- Packet link layer functionality.
- Duplicate detection.

The only changed files compared to the original tinyos tree is:

		MainC: removed the line that always includes TossimActiveMessageC			
		ActiveMessageC: added the CC2420 send and receive layers
		TossimRadioMsg.h: added packet link metadata

Add the following to your Makefile in order to compile.

CFLAGS += -I$(TOSCONTRIB)/csau/misc/tos/lib/tossim
CFLAGS += -I$(TOSDIR)/chips/cc2420/link
CFLAGS += -I$(TOSDIR)/chips/cc2420/unique
