<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
Many projects within <a href="http://www.mics.org" target="_blank">MICS</a> are sharing similar requirements in respect to hard- and software platforms. 
In order to accelerate the initial startup on hands-on experimentation and to facilitate the sharing of resources and know-how within MICS 
we propose a common base infrastructure that will be made available to MICS partners and supported by MICS staff.
</p>

<p>
The Sensor Network Platform Kit (SNPK) is made up of components that are considered to be the state-of-the-art and known-to-work. 
The unique approach combines both technology from industry as well as know-how and reliable prototypes from researchers to form a baseline opensource solution. 
The SNPK offers a service to researchers containing a shopping list for hardware components, downloadable software, 
technical support for affiliated members as well as an open community base for discussion and exchange
