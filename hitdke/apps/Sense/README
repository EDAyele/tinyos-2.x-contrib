This TinyOS application shows the basic usage of the TOSSIM DB simulator.

TOSSIM DB is the Data-Enriched Simulator for TinyOS applications. When a 
TinyOS application is compiled with this extension, its Sensor components
implicitly accesse a compile-time-specified, external data source (i.e. 
real historical data or synthetic data generator), and yield obtained data
*as if* sensed in real time.

PRE-REQUISITES:

  The following directives in the application's local Makefile are necessary for
  TOSSIM DB to i) compile correctly, and ii) locate third-party data source.

    HITDKEDIR ?= /opt/tinyos-2.x-contrib/hitdke
    TOSMAKE_PATH += $(HITDKEDIR)/support/make
    DATASOURCE = $(HITDKEDIR)/tos/lib/tossim/synsb/data/IntelLab/tossim-db.xml


HOW TO COMPILE:

  There are two alternatives compiling this application, one for on-mote execution 
  and the other for simulation with TOSSIM DB.

  a) Compile for burning to real sensor mote (i.e. MicaZ):

    $ env SENSORBOARD=basicsb make micaz install

  b) Compile for simulation with TOSSIM DB:

    $ env SENSORBOARD=synsb make micaz sim synsb


HOW TO EXECUTE:

  When the applications is compiled for TOSSIM DB simulation, it can be executed using
  the following Python script,

    $ ./sim-run.py
