1. set values of TIMESYNC_RATE, TIMESYNC_POLLER_RATE and TS_MICRO and 
	 program n motes with TestFTSP app
	 program 1 mote with TestTimeSyncPollerC app
2. program 1 mote as a BaseStation and connect it to PC
3. start SerialForwarder
4. start java logger by entering ./run
5. start all testtimesync motes as well as the poller
6. 'current_time_in_msg.report' file is created in pwd; this file is updated 
	 with data in the real time
7. let the experiment run for some time
8. start matlab and enter 
			FTSPDataAnalyzer('current_time_in_msg.report')
	 this will plot mean absolute timesync error, global time, and number of 
	 synced motes; this can be done while experiment is running
9. Matlab also creates data.out file which contains data in the following format 
		#seqNum mean_abs_error global_time num_synced_motes
		
	mean_abs_error is calculated as mean absolute deviation from the mean (mad) 
	 
Simulating multi-hop:
1. define TIMESYNC_DEBUG in the Makefile
2. recompile and upload TestFTSP app to n motes with special NODE_IDs:
	 using 'make micaz reinstall.0xAB', nodes 0xAB and 0xCD can communicate
	 iff 2D grid coordinates (A,B) and (C,D) are neighbors in a 2D grid
