Running Application
===================
$LGLDIR should be defined as per README in our main directory
1.upload base station node with 'rootNode' application
2.upload a number of nodes with 'camNode' application (use different IDs)
3.run serialforwarder on your PC (e.g. on COM1: '$TOSROOT/support/sdk/c/sf/sf 9002 /dev/ttyS0 115200')
4.in the 'c' directory, run 'get_jpg 9002 1' to get bw jpg image from mote #1

=======================
buidling get_jpg.c file
=======================
1.make sure that libmote.a is available in one of the standard directories
(/usr/lib or /usr/local/lib), if not, copy $LGLDIR/support/sdk/c/sf/Makefile.am
to /opt/tinyos-2.x/support/sdk/c/sf and rebuild the mote library (starting with
'./bootstrap', make sure to do 'make install')
2.also need jpeg-6b library
3.build $LGLDIR/support/sdk/c/camera_cmd and 'make install' it
4.finally build get_jpg.c file
