ARBUTUS: ROUTING ON THE HAIRY EDGE

ArbutusTest is a continuous many-to-one collection app to test out Arbutus.

Here are the key parameters to get started:
BASE_STATION_ADDRESS is the address of your sink. This is a single-sink implementation.
DEFAULT_INTERVAL is the interval between data packets.
BEACON_PERIOD is the interval between control packets.

For any questions, shoot me an e-mail at daniele.puccinelli@supsi.ch.

I've laid everything out so that you can easily test out Arbutus on MoteLab.

- make telosb
- upload the binary and the dataMsg.class to log all packets that get delivered to the sink


I'll post more usage instructions right here asap.
